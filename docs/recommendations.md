# Recommendations

This document lists recommendations from the Security SIG for
the consideration of OpenTelemetry SIGs.

## CodeQL Scanning

The organization uses [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/) for semantic analysis
of the code in various repositories. The recommendation is to run CodeQL on every
pull request and on every commit to the main branch.
